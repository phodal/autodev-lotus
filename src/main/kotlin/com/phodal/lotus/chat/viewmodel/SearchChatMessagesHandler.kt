     *
     * This flow can emit the following states:
     * - [SearchState.Idle]: Indicates no active search operation is ongoing.
     * - [SearchState.Searching]: Represents an active search operation with the associated query.
     * - [SearchState.SearchResults]: Contains the results of the search operation, including the matching
     *   message IDs, the query used, and the index of the currently selected search result.
     *
     * This property is intended to be observed by consumers to react to search state changes
     * and provide appropriate updates to the UI or other components.
